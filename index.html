            <h3> Learning the Known Unknown ‚ÜîÔ∏è Seeking the Unknown Unknown </h3>
            <p>Exploring helped me understand what I have yet to know and realise what I have not yet known.<br><br>
                Exploration led me to see what I was passionate about and the vast opportunities available out there. Yet it led me to see the imperfection of the world and understand that nothing is perfect in the world. 
                <br><br>
                Having the explorer's mind allows me to be aware of what's happening and what's to come. It keeps me motivated to test boundaries responsibly and venture into the unkown.

            <h3>Recognizing the Negativity, Cultivating the Positivity</h3>
            <p>The only way to stop the spread of negativity is not to criticize those who spreads it, but to focus on continuing doing good. After all, if one does not believe the world is good, how does one go about changing the world for the better?<br><br>
                As I quote from one of my favourite movies, <em>Tomorrowland:</em><br><br>
                "There are two wolves who are always fighting. One is darkness and despair. The other is light and hope. The question is: which wolf wins?" <br><br>

It also records the searches done by the users for referencing if needed.

                Some of the webscraping libraries used were Selenium and BeautifulSoup and I have coded programs to automate collection of data, such as retrieving stock prices from the Stock Market and perform simple daily tasks that requires signing in online.

                This was my first personal project. I created a desktop application to track my expenses. In this project, I used Python and Kivy to build the application. The project was initially meant to be made into a phone application, but I was met with difficulties using a virtual machine. Therefore I made some adjustments and it became a desktop application instead.<br> 
                Even though the project did not turn out as I expected, the project introduced me to virtual machine and also taught me how to adjust based on circumstances in coding.

                It is only through giving can one truly receive. At different stages of life, volunteering had different purposes. As of right now, volunteering is a means for me to do good and remind myself that life is not just about academics and work. It is also through the process I hope to rediscover myself again.
                <!-- As a secondary school kid, volunteering to me was the opportunity to experience something cool. Whether it was the school's overseas volunteering programme or the 25th SEA Games, the experiences convinced the kid that life is more than just studying. <br>
                As a JC kid, volunteering to me was a chore. It was something that I hunted for in order to clear hours required. But at the end, looking at the hours accumulated I asked, what was it that I gained? I could not give a firm answer...
                As a university kid, volunteering to me is to remind myself that life is not just about academics and work, but it is also to give and pay it forward, like how you have received before. It is also a means to find purpose and to rediscover myself as a person. -->

                Photography is a way to capture a memory as well as a means to tell a story. It serves as a reminder that life is full of wonderful moments, you just need to take the initiative to appreciate it. :)
